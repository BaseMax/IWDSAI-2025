# IWDSAI-2025 -> Using AI to Model Real-World Systems: From Weather to Economics

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the abstract of my talk titled **"Using AI to Model Real-World Systems: From Weather to Economics"** for the **Fifth International Workshop on Dynamical Systems & AI (IWDS&AI 2025)**, which will be held on **April 16-17, 2025**, at the **University of Kufa, AlNajaf, Iraq**.

## Abstract

Many real-world systems—such as the weather, financial markets, and ecosystems—change over time in ways that are difficult to predict. Traditionally, we have used mathematical tools like differential equations and dynamical systems theory to understand them. However, with the rise of AI, we now have new ways to model and make sense of these complex patterns.

In this talk, I explore how machine learning and neural networks can be used to build models of real-world dynamical systems. Examples from weather forecasting and economic trends will show where AI shines, where it struggles, and how it can complement traditional models. We’ll also look at modern techniques like LSTMs, and discuss why blending AI with domain knowledge often leads to better, more reliable results.

## Repository Structure

- `IWDSAI-2025.tex`: The LaTeX source code for generating the abstract PDF.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.

## How to Compile the LaTeX File

To generate the PDF for the abstract:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/IWDSAI-2025.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd IWDSAI-2025
   ```

Use any LaTeX editor (such as Overleaf or TeXShop) to open the IWDSAI-2025.tex file and compile it into a PDF.

Alternatively, you can compile the .tex file manually using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pdflatex IWDSAI-2025.tex
```

This will generate a PDF with the abstract for the conference.
